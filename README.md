# Super-resolution qDESS experiment


This project focuses on using k-space aliasing in qDESS to achieve super-resolution in MRI. The suggested technique is demonstrated in principle via EPF simulation ( 'qDESS_EPG_simulation'), and the super-resolution reconstruction is attempted in 2D knee scan ('qDESS_SR_recon'). This project was part of the final Year 4 project in the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London. 
All codes are written in MATLAB.
