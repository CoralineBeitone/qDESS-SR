# Super-resolution qDESS experiment

This project focuses on the use of k-space aliasing in qDESS to obtain super-resolution in MRI. The proposed technique is demonstrated in principle via EPG simulation (`qDESS_EPG_simulation`), and the super-resolution reconstruction is attempted in a 2D knee scan (`qDESS_SR_recon`). This work was part of the 4-year final project in the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London. All codes are written in MATLAB
